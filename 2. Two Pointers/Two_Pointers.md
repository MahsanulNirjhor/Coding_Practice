# Two Pointers in Coding

Two pointers is a technique in computer programming where two variables are used to traverse an array or other data structure. The pointers are typically initialized to point to the beginning and end of the data structure, and then they are moved in tandem until a desired condition is met.

## What is two pointers?

Two pointers is a simple and elegant technique that is easy to understand and implement. It is often more efficient than other techniques, such as brute force search. Two pointers can be used to solve a variety of problems, including sorting, searching, and pattern matching.

## Why use two pointers?

Two pointers can be used to solve a variety of problems in computer programming. Some common problems that can be solved using two pointers include:

* Finding the maximum or minimum value in an array
* Finding the first occurrence of a given value in an array
* Finding the longest increasing or decreasing subsequence in an array
* Sorting an array
* Finding the longest common subsequence of two strings

## How does two pointers work?

The two pointers technique works by moving the pointers in tandem until a desired condition is met. For example, to find the maximum value in an array, we can initialize the two pointers to point to the first and last element of the array. We then repeatedly compare the values pointed to by the pointers, and move the smaller pointer one position forward. The larger pointer will eventually point to the maximum value in the array.

## Advantages of two pointers

* Simple and elegant technique
* Often more efficient than other techniques
* Can be used to solve a variety of problems

## Disadvantages of two pointers

* Can be more difficult to implement than other techniques
* May not be as efficient for problems with large data sets
* May not be applicable to all problems

## Conclusion

Two pointers is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a variety of problems in computer programming. It is a simple and elegant technique that is easy to understand and implement. However, it is not always the best solution for every problem.

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples of how to use two pointers in Python:

python
def find_maximum_value(array):
    left_pointer = 0
    right_pointer = len(array) - 1

    maximum_value = array[left_pointer]

    while left_pointer <= right_pointer:
        if array[left_pointer] > maximum_value:
            maximum_value = array[left_pointer]

        left_pointer += 1

    return maximum_value


def find_first_occurrence_of_value(array, value):
    left_pointer = 0
    right_pointer = len(array) - 1

    found = False

    while left_pointer <= right_pointer and not found:
        if array[left_pointer] == value:
            found = True
        else:
            left_pointer += 1

    return left_pointer if found else -1
```
```

## Questions to ask to detect if a coding problem can be solved using two pointers

* Does the problem involve finding the maximum or minimum value in a data structure?
* Does the problem involve finding the first occurrence of a given value in a data structure?
* Does the problem involve finding the longest increasing or decreasing subsequence in a data structure?
* Does the problem involve sorting a data structure?
* Does the problem involve finding the longest common subsequence of two strings?

## Patterns that indicate a problem can be solved using two pointers

* The problem involves moving through a data structure from beginning to end (or vice versa).
* The problem involves finding a pair of elements in a data structure that satisfy a certain condition.
* The problem involves finding the longest substring of a string that satisfies a certain condition.
* The problem involves finding the longest increasing or decreasing subsequence in a data structure.

## Examples of coding problems that can be solved using two pointers

* Find the maximum value in an array.
* Find the first occurrence of a given value in an array.
* Find the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
* Sort an array.
* Find the longest common subsequence of two strings.

## Examples of coding problems that **cannot** be solved using two pointers

* Find the number of distinct elements in an array.
* Find the median of an array.
* Find the kth smallest element in an array.
* Reverse an array.
* Rotate an array.

## Additional notes

* The two pointers technique can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, but it is not always the best solution. In some cases, other techniques, such as brute force search or dynamic programming, may be more efficient.
* It is important to be familiar with the different patterns that can be solved using two pointers. This will help you to quickly identify problems that are good candidates for this technique.
* There are many resources available online and in textbooks that can help you learn more about two pointers. I recommend checking out some of these resources if you are interested in learning more about this technique.


Sure, here is a list of the classifications of two pointers, along with the key points to identify them and some examples of problems that can be solved using each classification:


**Classification** | **Key points to identify** | **Examples of problems**
---|---|---|
**Collision** | The two pointers start at opposite ends of the data structure and move towards each other. | Find the first and last occurrence of a given value in an array. Find the maximum and minimum values in an array.
**Forward** | The two pointers start at the same end of the data structure and move in the same direction. | Find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Find the longest common subsequence of two strings.
**Parallel** | The two pointers start at the same end of two different data structures and move in the same direction. | Merge two sorted arrays. Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
**Sliding window** | The two pointers move in the same direction, but the second pointer is always k elements behind the first pointer. | Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k. Find the longest substring with no repeated characters.


Here are some additional notes about the classifications of two pointers:


* The collision classification is the most common type of two pointers problem.
* The forward classification is often used to solve problems related to finding the longest increasing or decreasing subsequences.
* The parallel classification is often used to solve problems related to merging or finding the intersection of two data structures.
* The sliding window classification is often used to solve problems related to finding the maximum sum of a subarray or the longest substring with no repeated characters.
